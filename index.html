    <!-- BIO -->
    <section>
      <p>
        I’m an experienced developer focused on building systems that scale, feel intentional,
        and respect the user. My work sits at the intersection of web design, software
        development, and experimental technology — with a strong emphasis on polish,
        performance, and long-term maintainability.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m the founder and lead developer behind Slayd Development (linked below), where I
        build and refine interactive experiences, internal tools, and front-end systems
        designed to be both performant and visually intentional. Slayd Development serves as
        the hub for my public work, experiments, and long-term projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond my own work, I’ve assisted in the development of two major Roblox games,
        contributing to large-scale systems used by tens of thousands of players. Working at
        that scale taught me how quickly small design decisions compound — and how important
        performance, stability, and clarity become when real users are involved.
      </p>

      <p>
        I regularly build under real constraints: performance limits, large user bases,
        hardware differences, time pressure, and compatibility across older systems and
        devices. Just because something works on a high-end machine doesn’t mean it’s
        acceptable. Good systems should adapt to the user — not the other way around.
      </p>

      <p>
        A large portion of my work remains private or experimental: internal tools, beta
        systems, archived builds, and paused projects that may resurface when the timing is
        right. I prefer shipping things when they’re ready, not rushed.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m also a Windows Insider (Dev Channel), which reflects how I approach technology —
        staying close to evolving platforms, analyzing UX decisions early, and understanding
        how small details scale across millions of users.
      </p>

      <p>
        I strongly believe good software should feel intentional and respectful, even if that
        means slowing down. Refinement almost always beats rushing something out, even when
        people are waiting. I notice details most people don’t — timing, spacing, transitions —
        and once I see them, I can’t unsee them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Long-term, I aim to be known as a developer who builds things people remember — not
        because they’re popular, but because they’re well-made. Someone respected for both
        technical depth and approachability, and for caring about quality at scale.
